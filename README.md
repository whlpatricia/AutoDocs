# AutoDocs: From Logs to Docs
Upload your Asciinema terminal recording and convert it into documentation that you can share with your friends or colleagues. This [project](https://wiki.faikvm.com/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page#AutoDoc) is created under the mentorship program of The Human Feedback Foundation and Linux Foundation, with mentors [Julia Longtin](https://github.com/julialongtin) and [Arthur Wolf](https://github.com/arthurwolf).

## Our webapp
Access our hosted webapp [here](https://autodocs-production.up.railway.app) or watch our [demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ssCTLpFQCOF0IWctK1j3NYFi1jjNiI9B/view?usp=sharing)!
*Note that the generation feature may not work fully as the models are not hosted due to usage limits.

## Architecture
Our webapp is built on **Next.js** with a **PostgreSQL** database. [Our model pipeline](https://github.com/CSC392-CSC492-Building-AI-ML-systems/AutoDocs-Winter2026/blob/main/host_pipeline.ipyn
b) is currently hosted using Colab Pro and exposed to the backend using an Ngrok tunnel.

- Parser 0 converts the Asciinema recordings into XML format for easier processing.
- Model 0, our finetuned Microsoft Phi model, takes the XML input and categorizes it into new or old events.
- Parser 1 wraps the created events with the relevant XML parts.
- Model 1, our finetuned Deepseek R1 model, takes the events and generates the event tree by finding the relationship between the events.
